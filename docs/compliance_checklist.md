# Compliance & Quality Checklist

This checklist tracks repository hygiene tasks required for submission readiness.

## 1. Secret Management
- ✅ No API keys or service account credentials committed (verified via `.env` usage and `.gitignore`).
- ✅ README and docs remind contributors not to commit secrets (see README Deployment section).
- ☐ Automation: add `detect-secrets` or pre-commit hook (optional; note for future).

## 2. Licensing & Attribution
- ✅ Project inherits repository license (verify `LICENSE` file from base repo).
- ✅ External datasets referenced with attribution in `docs/data_sources.md`.
- ✅ Screenshots and transcripts are generated by the team; no third-party copyrighted media embedded.
- ☐ Add explicit credit to Google ADK samples when adapting code snippets (review `src/it_ops_observability` comments by Nov 30).

## 3. Contribution Guidelines
- ✅ `CONTRIBUTING.md` available upstream (ADK). Local project uses internal notes; no external contributors expected.
- ☐ If collaborators join, add lightweight `CONTRIBUTING.md` or `docs/collaboration_guide.md` (not required for solo submission).

## 4. Data Governance
- ✅ Synthetic data generators documented in `docs/data_sources.md` and `src/it_ops_observability/synthetic.py`.
- ✅ Usage of public Kaggle datasets aligns with their terms (read-only, attribution included).
- ✅ No PII or customer data stored.

## 5. Testing & Evidence
- ✅ Project-level tests (`tests/test_dashboard.py`, `tests/test_tools.py`) passing with `PYTHONPATH=src`.
- ✅ Evaluation artifacts archived in `reports/evaluation/examples/` with timestamps.
- ☐ Optional: configure CI or GitHub Actions for smoke tests (out of scope for submission timeline).

## 6. Documentation Completeness
- ✅ README, architecture, data, evaluation, deployment, cost docs up to date.
- ✅ Storytelling assets plan captured in `docs/storytelling_assets.md`.
- ✅ Submission outline and draft maintained (`docs/submission_outline.md`, `docs/submission_draft.md`).

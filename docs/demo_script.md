# Three-Minute Demo Script

Use this to record the <3 minute YouTube submission. It hits the required beats (problem, agents, architecture, demo, build) while staying snappy.

---

## Quick Setup (2 minutes before)
- Open the deployed Streamlit page (Cloud Run or localhost) and pause at the landing screen.
- Keep the architecture graphic (`assets/enterprise_it_ops_architecture.png`) and README tab ready.
- Export `GOOGLE_API_KEY` locally so you can demo the CLI fallback if needed.

## Timeline

### 0:00 – 0:25  •  Hook & Problem
- On camera or voice over the Streamlit title screen.
- Script: “Outages force IT leaders to scramble through logs, metrics, and emails before executives hear anything. That chaos can burn valuable minutes to hours. This project builds an Enterprise IT Operations Supervisor Agent so leadership gets a trustworthy briefing in under few minutes.”

### 0:25 – 0:55  •  Why Agents
- Show the sidebar with the prompt block.
- Script: “Gemini coordinates three specialists: Log Analyst, Metric Analyst, and Operations Planner. Each one pulls structured data, reasons over it, and hands the findings back to the supervisor. That orchestration is what collapses the investigation timeline.”

### 0:55 – 1:20  •  Architecture Snapshot
- Switch to the architecture image.
- Script highlights:
  - “Supervisor agent on top, specialists below.”
  - “Tools as defined `src/it_ops_observability/tools.py` they call upon our log and metric adapters.”
  - The Deterministic synthetic data keeps demos stable while letting us plug in real telemetry later.”

### 1:20 – 2:05  •  Live Demo Beat
- Return to Streamlit, click **Run supervisor** right before you start talking.
- Narrate while the run completes:
  - “The supervisor fans out requests, waits for each specialist, then assembles a briefing.”
  - Scroll the transcript briefly: “Here’s the log analyst surfacing error spikes; the metric analyst quantifying CPU and memory; the planner translating that into actions and stakeholder comms.”
  - Flip to the dashboard tab: “Charts, severity counts, and the incident digest are generated by the same helper we unit test in `tests/test_dashboard.py`.”

### 2:05 – 2:35  •  The Build
- Overlay README or VS Code split view.
- Script: “All of this runs in Streamlit, packaged with the Google ADK agents. The Dockerfile pushes straight to Cloud Run, `docs/deployment_guide.md` spells out `gcloud builds submit` and `gcloud run deploy`, and pytest keeps the tools deterministic.”

### 2:35 – 2:55  •  Impact & Close
- Back to Streamlit or architecture hero shot.
- Script: “Result: leadership gets a concise briefing in minutes, backed by auditable transcripts and dashboards. It shows how enterprise teams can trust LLM agents for operations when you mix orchestration, tooling, observability, and deployment.”

### 2:55 – 3:00  •  Call to Action
- “Check the repo for the Cloud Run instructions and evaluation logs. Thanks for watching!”

Keep delivery energetic, trim silence between sections, and you’ll land comfortably under three minutes.

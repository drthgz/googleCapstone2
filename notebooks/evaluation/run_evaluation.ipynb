    "# Evaluation Runner Notebook\n",
    "Use this notebook to reproduce the Gemini-backed supervisor run exactly as it appears in our documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "- Activate the project virtual environment (e.g., `source .venv/bin/activate`).\n",
    "- Ensure `.env` is populated with `GOOGLE_API_KEY` and any other required configuration.\n",
    "- Verify the repository root contains all installed dependencies (`pip install -r requirements.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What the notebook does\n",
    "1. Sets `PYTHONPATH` to include `src` so ADK imports resolve.\n",
    "2. Loads key/value pairs from `.env` into the subprocess environment (without overwriting already-exported variables).\n",
    "3. Invokes `scripts/run_adk_supervisor.py --verbose` with the standard prompt set to capture a full leadership briefing.\n",
    "4. Prints STDOUT and STDERR so the transcript can be archived or inspected inline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Re-run the single code cell below after quotas reset to collect a fresh transcript for evaluation artifacts."

      "\n",
      "*   **CPU Utilization:** Repeatedly flagged as \"approaching threshold\" (WARNING level) at multiple intervals. This indicates sustained high CPU load.\n",
      "*   **Disk Saturation:** Critically high disk usage (\"beyond 95%\") occurred multiple times, marked as ERROR. This is a severe condition that can lead to system instability and data loss.\n",
      "*   **Replica Lag:** Observed to be \"increasing\" (WARNING level) at several points. This impacts data consistency and recovery capabilities.\n",
      "*   **Cache Connection Issues:** Repeated \"retrying connection to cache cluster\" (WARNING level) suggests problems with cache accessibility or performance.\n",
      "*   **API Gateway Latency:** A specific instance of a \"latency spike\" (ERROR level) was recorded, indicating performance issues affecting external access.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Identified Risks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **System Instability and Downtime:** The combination of high CPU, disk saturation, and database connection timeouts points to a significant risk of system instability and potential outages. The open service mesh circuit breakers further exacerbate this risk by isolating services.\n",
      "2.  **Data Loss or Corruption:** Disk saturation and increasing replica lag pose a risk to data integrity. If not addressed, this could lead to data loss or corruption.\n",
      "3.  **Degraded Performance:** The frequent warnings about CPU utilization, cache connection issues, and the API gateway latency spike all indicate that the application's performance is degraded, which can negatively impact user experience and business operations.\n",
      "4.  **Cascading Failures:** The interconnected nature of these issues (e.g., high CPU could lead to cache issues, which could impact database connections) means there's a risk of cascading failures where one problem triggers others.\n",

      "\n",
      "Overnight, `prod-app-01` experienced a series of critical performance issues, including multiple database connection timeouts, API gateway latency spikes, and severe disk saturation. These events indicate a significant degradation in service stability and performance, posing an immediate risk to operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Incidents & Observations:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Database Connectivity:** Two critical database connection timeouts occurred at 05:10 and 05:20.\n",
      "*   **API Performance:** A significant latency spike was detected on the API Gateway at 05:30.\n",
      "*   **Resource Saturation:** Disk usage repeatedly exceeded 95% (ERROR level) at 03:15, 04:00, and 04:20.\n",
      "*   **System Strain:** CPU utilization was frequently noted as \"approaching threshold\" (WARNING level) throughout the observed period.\n",
      "*   **Data Replication Issues:** Increasing replica lag was observed at multiple intervals, raising concerns about data consistency.\n",
      "*   **Service Mesh Faults:** The service mesh circuit breaker was repeatedly opened (ERROR level), indicating potential communication failures between services.\n",
      "*   **Cache Connectivity:** The system experienced difficulties connecting to the cache cluster, requiring retries.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Top Risks:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Service Outage:** The combination of database timeouts, API latency, and circuit breaker issues creates a high risk of a complete service outage.\n",
      "2.  **Data Integrity Compromise:** Persistent disk saturation and replica lag could lead to data loss or corruption.\n",
      "3.  **Prolonged Performance Degradation:** If the underlying causes are not addressed, users may experience continued slow response times and intermittent service access.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Recommended Actions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Immediate Root Cause Analysis:** The technical team must prioritize a deep-dive investigation to identify the root cause of the disk saturation, database timeouts, and API latency.\n",
      "2.  **Resource Allocation Review:** Conduct an urgent review of resource allocation for `prod-app-01`, focusing on disk space, CPU, and memory to ensure adequate provisioning.\n",
      "3.  **Monitoring Enhancement:** Implement enhanced monitoring and alerting for disk space, database connection pool health, and API latency to enable faster detection of future issues.\n",
      "4.  **System Stability Testing:** Schedule immediate post-resolution stability testing to confirm the resilience of `prod-app-01` under load.\n",
      "\n",
      "We recommend immediate attention to these issues to mitigate further risks and restore optimal performance.\n",
